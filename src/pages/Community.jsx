                  We have zero tolerance for sexual harassment. We define sexual
                  harassment as any non-physical, unwanted, and unwelcome sexual
                  behaviors between members. This includes cyber flashing (i.e.
                  sharing unsolicited sexually explicit images), in-person
                  indecent exposure, sharing or threatening to share sexual or
                  intimate images without the consent of the person involved or
                  depicted, sending unwanted sexual comments or images, and
                  fetishization.

                  We do not allow any type of unsolicited or irrelevant content
                  sent in large quantities or at a high frequency. This includes
                  sharing misleading or misdirecting links, creating an
                  excessive number of accounts that disrupt other members, or
                  maintaining multiple active profiles on our platform to engage
                  in unwanted interactions. Users found engaging in spammy
